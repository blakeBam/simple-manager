# Simple Manager
A productivity app that I'm working on in my spare time.

The current features available are a functioning todo list with adding and removing items when desired.

Planned features are a recurring list where tasks can be completed on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Improved user interface and design. Custimaizable notifications which remind you of recurring and one time tasks.

The app can be found on the google play store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bambi.android.to_do_list
